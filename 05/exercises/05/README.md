### Exercise 5.05
Is the following `if` statement legal?
```
if (n >= 1 <= 10)
    printf("n is between 1 and 10\n");
If so, what does it do when `n` is equal to 5?
```
### Solution
Yes, this `if` statement is legal. When `n` is equal to 5, the expression will be true and the `printf` statement will run.

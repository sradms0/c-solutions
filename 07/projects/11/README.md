### Project 7.11
Write a program that takes a first name and last name entered by the user and displays the last name, a comma, and the first initial, followed by a period:
```
Enter a first and last name: Lloyd Fosdick
Fosdick, L.
```
The user's input may contain extra spaces before the first name, between the first and last names, and after the last name.

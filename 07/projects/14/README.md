### Project 7.14
Write a program that uses Newton's method to compute the square root of a positive floating-point number:
```
Enter a positive number: 3
Square root: 1.73205
```
Let `x` be the number entered by the user. Newtonâ€™s method requires an initial guess `y` for computing the average of `x/y`. The following table shows how the square root of 3 would be found:

| **x** |    **y**    |   **x/y**   | **Average of y and x/y** |
|---|---------|---------|----------------------|
| 3 |1        |3        |2                     | 
| 3 |2        |1.5      |1.75                  | 
| 3 |1.75     |1.71429  |1.73214               | 
| 3 |1.73214  |1.73196  |1.73205               | 
| 3 |1.73205  |1.73205  |1.73205               | 

Note that the values of `y` get progressively closer to the true square root of `x`. For greater accuracy, your program should use variables of type `double` rather than `float.` Have the program terminate when the absolute value of the difference between the old value of `y` and the new value of `y` is less than the product of .00001 and `y`. *Hint:* Call the `fabs` function to find the absolute value of a `double.` (You'll need to include the `<math.h>` header at the beginning of your program in order to use `fabs.`)

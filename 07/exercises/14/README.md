### Exercise 7.14
Does the following statement always compute the fractional part of `f` correctly (assuming that `f` and `frac_part` are `float` variables)?
```c
frac_part = f - (int) f;
```
If not, whatâ€™s the problem?
### Solution
No. If `f` is larger than the maximum size of `int`, the casting of `f` to `int` will not work.

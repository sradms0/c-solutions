### Exercise 7.12
Suppose that `i` is a variable of type `int`, `f` is a variable of type `float`, and `d` is a variable of type `double.` Explain what conversions take place during the execution of the following statement:
`d = i + f;`

### Solution
The sum of `i` and `f` is converted to a `float`. The total is then converted to `double`, as `d` is of type `double`.

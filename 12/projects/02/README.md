### Project 12.02
(a) Write a program that reads a message, then checks whether it’s a palindrome (the letters in the message are the same from left to right as from tight to left):

```
Enter a message: He lived as a devil, eh?
Palindrome

Enter a message: Madam, I am Adam.
Not a palindrome
```
Ignore all characters that aren't letters. Use integer variables to keep track of positions in the array.  

(b) Revise the program to use pointers instead of integers to keep track of positions in the array.

### Solution
See `2.c`

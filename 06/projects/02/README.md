### Project 6.02
Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, then calculates and displays their greatest common divisor (GCD):
```
Enter two integers: 12 28
Greatest common divisor: 4
```

*Hint:* &nbsp;The classic algorithm for computing the GCD, known as Euclid’s algorithm, goes as
follows: Let `m` and `n` be variables containing the two numbers. If `n` is 0, then stop: `m` contains the GCD. Otherwise, compute the remainder when `m` is divided by `n`. Copy `n` into `m` and copy the remainder into `n`. Then repeat the process, starting with testing whether n is 0.

### Solution
See `2.c`

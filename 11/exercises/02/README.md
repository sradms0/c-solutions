### Exercise 11.02
If `i` is an `int` variable and `p` and `q` are pointers to `int`, which of the following assignments are legal?  

(a) `p = i;`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)`p = &q;`&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) `p = *q;`  
(b) `*p = &i;`&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)`p = *&q;`(h) `*p = q;`  
(c) `&p = q;`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) `p = q;`  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) `*p = *q;`

### Solution
Assignments in e, f, and i are legal.

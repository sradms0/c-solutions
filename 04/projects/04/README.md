### Project 4.04
Write a program that reads an integer entered by the user and displays it in octal (base 8):
```
Enter a number between 0 and 32767: 1953
In octal, your number is: 03461
```
The output should be displayed using five digits, even if fewer digits are sufficient. *Hint:* To convert the number to octal, first divide the original number by 8 and repeat the process to arrive at the next-to-last digit. (`printf` is capable of displaying numbers in base 8, as we'll see in Chapter 7, so there's actually an easier way to write this progam.)

### Solution
See `4.c`

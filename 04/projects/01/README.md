### Project 4.01
Write a program that asks the user to enter a two-digit number, then prints the number with its digits reserved. A session with the program should have the following appearance:
```
Enter a two-digit number: 28
The reversal is: 82
```
Read the numbers using `%d`, then break it into digits. *Hint:* If `n` is an integer, then `n % 10` is the last digit `n` and `n / 10` `n` with the last digit removed.
### Solution
See `1.c`

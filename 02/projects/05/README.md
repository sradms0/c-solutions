### Project 2.05
Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for `x` and then displays the value of the following polynomial:
`3x⁵ + 2x⁴ - 5x³ - x² + 7x - 6`

*Hint*: C doesn't have han exponentiation operator, so you'll need to multipy `x` by itself repeatedly in order to compute the powerso f `x`. (For example, `x*x*x` is `x` cubed.)

### Solution
See `5.c`

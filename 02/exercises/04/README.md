### Exercise 2.04
Write a program that declares several `int` and `float` variables--without initializing them--and then prints their values. Is there any pattern to the values? (Usually there isn't.)

### Solution
There seems to be no pattern to these values. Something to note, though, is the values of `int` data types are random integers, but the values for `float` identifiers are 0.000000.

### Exercise 2.05
Which of the following are not legal C identifiers?  
(a) `100_bottles`  
(b) `_100__bottles`  
(c) `one__hundred__bottles`  
(d) `bottles_by_the_hundred_`

### Solution
(a) `100_bottles`  
An identifier cannot begin with a digit.

(b) `_100__bottles`  
Identifiers beginning with an underscore are restricted depending on the compilers, but this should be avoided anyway since names begin with an underscore.

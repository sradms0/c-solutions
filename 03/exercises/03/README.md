### Exercise 3.03
For each of the following pairs of `scanf` format strings, indicate whether or not the two strings are equivalent. If they're not, show how they can be distinguished.  
(a) `"%d"`        versus `" %d"`  
(b) `"%d-%d-%d"`  versus `"%d -%d -%d"`  
(c) `"%f"`        versus `"%f "`  
(d) `"%f,%f"`     versus `"%f, %f"`

### Solution
(a) These are equal pairs.  
(b) These are equal pairs.  
(c) These pairs are not equal. The user would have to enter a non-white-space after a float is entered.  
(d) These are equal pairs.

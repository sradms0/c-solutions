### Project 9.06
Write a function that computes the value of the following polynomial:
```
3x⁵ + 2x⁴ - 5x³ - x² + 7x - 6
```

Write a program that asks the user to enter a value for `x`, calls the function to compute the value of the polynomial, and then displays the value returned by the function.

### Solution
See `6.c`
